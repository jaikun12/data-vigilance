			<h2>What is data?</h2>
			<h3>A simple google search will give you this.</h3>
			<p>Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, /ˈdætə/ DA-tə, or /ˈdɑːtə/ DAH-tə)[1] is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. Pieces of data are individual pieces of information. While the concept of data is commonly associated with scientific research, data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, including businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), governments (e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).</p>

			<h3 class="oswald">This may be the definition of data. But in reality, data is everything you collect to create <a href="http://www.twotwelve.com/voice/what-is-meaningful-information.html" target="_blank">meaningful information</a>.</h3>
			<h4>But why is data powerful?</p>

			<h2 class="oswald">The Power of Data</h2>
			<h4>For this storytelling, we will use the 2013 national crime statistics which can be found <a href="http://data.gov.ph/dataset/national-crime-statistics">here</a>.</h4>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<h5>Data can be easily used to create misleading information. This is an example.</h5>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/tot-crime-volume.png">
			<div id="ncr">
				<h3 class="emphasize">NCR</h3>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="feature-tile">
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3>Total Amount of Crime in NCR</h3>

							<h3>Crime Volume Ranking in PH</h3>
							<span class="emphasize">1st</span>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>From this single chart of data from the dataset, people could start creating conclusions that NCR is the most unsafe place in the Philippines.</p>
			<p>Articles may come up from the media that the PNP is doing badly in the National Capital Region, causing people to have low satisfaction for their services.</p>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<h3>But is that really the case?</h3>

		<div id="deeper">
			<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>
			<h5>As we use more of data that we have, we find out more about the truth.</h5>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-vol-sol.png">
			<p>From this chart, we could actually see that the National Capital Region has the most number of crimes solved.

			<h5>Leading us to this chart.</h5>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-sol-eff.png">
			<h3>NCR has a Crime Solution Efficiency of</h3>
			<h3 class="emphasize">62%</h3>
			<p>From this chart, we could say that the National Capital Region is one of the top performers in solving crimes.</p>
			<p>This debunks our conclusion from the initial chart, that the National Capital Region is the most unsafe place in the Philippines.</p>

			<h2>Clearing Misconceptions</h2>
			<h5>With data, of course.</h5>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/news.png">
			<h5>A headline of an article you can find <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/161194/travel-advisory-uk-united-kingdom-mindanao-cebu-visayas-tourism-terrorism">here</a>.</h5>
			<p>As a child born in the Philippines, Mindanao has always been considered as a dangerous place.
			 Multiple stints done by rebel groups, acts of terrorism, and even political killings, has put Mindanao into bad light both to locals and tourists.</p>

			<h4>But is Mindanao really unsafe?</h4>
			<h5>Let's set aside all of these things and look at the major islands in the Philippines through the eyes of data.</h5>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-vol-by-isl.png">
			<div id="">
				<div class="container">
					<div class="feature-tile">
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3>Luzon</h3>
							<span class="emphasize">617,266</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="feature-tile">
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3>Visayas</h3>
							<span class="emphasize">330,164</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="feature-tile">
						<div class="feature-content">
							<h3>Mindanao</h3>
							<span class="emphasize">291,387</span>
						</div>
					</div>

			<p>In this chart, I grouped together the regions in the Philippines by Major Island Groups. Mindanao consists of ARMM, Caraga, Davao Region, Soccsksargen, Northern Mindanao, and Zamboanga Peninsula. Visayas consists of Western Visayas, Central Visayas, and Eastern Visayas. Luzon consists of NCR, Central Luzon, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, Bicol Region, Ilocos Region, Cordillera Valley, and Cagayan Valley.</p>

			<p>As what you can see from the above, Mindanao actually ranks last in Total Crime Volume. That's one point for Mindanao for being the safest Major Island in the Philippines based on data.</p>

			<h3>Let's dig deeper and check how the major islands compare to each other.</h3>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/index-ave-mon-rate.png">
			<p>Now this chart describes the average monthly rate of index crimes per major island. It is the amount of index crimes that occur every month for every 100,000 people in the population. As you can see, Mindanao only ranks second in this matter.</p>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/non-index-total-isl.png">
			<p>This time, the chart above shows the total of all the non-index crimes per major island. Mindanao ranks last, and is the safest. Considering that non-index crimes are the most abundant type of crimes that occur.</p>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-sol-eff-isl.png">
			<p>Last but not the least, even in solving crimes, Mindanao is not ranked at the last place.</p>
			<p>Now, this may look like I'm putting Visayas on a bad light. Please understand that these are the data themselves, showing you the truth without bias.</p>
			<h2>The Takeaways</h2>
			<h5>This may be short, but I hope you learned something.</h5>
			<p>From what we have discussed in this website, we can see that data can be used both to give meaningful information and even create misinformation.</p>
			<p>Looking at data in only one way, could make us see something that is wrong, and could be manipulated. This is something that we discussed on the earlier parts of this website. Looking at NCRs data in an incomplete manner, without digging further may lead us to conclusions that are wrong and may be misleading. Data is indeed powerful, it is something that could clear up misconceptions and even help us in finding solutions. This discussion might be shallow, but it is an hopeful attempt in making you understand how data can be used to show a story and provide a picture of facts to people.</p>
			<p>I encourage you to explore and study data. We have started something here, and you can continue in creating meaningful information for everyone. Always seek the truth, be vigilant.

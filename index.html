			<h2>What is data?</h2>
			<h3>A simple google search will give you this.</h3>
			<p>Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, /ˈdætə/ DA-tə, or /ˈdɑːtə/ DAH-tə)[1] is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. Pieces of data are individual pieces of information. While the concept of data is commonly associated with scientific research, data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, including businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), governments (e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).</p>

			<h3 class="oswald">This may be the definition of data. But in reality, data is everything you collect to create <a href="http://www.twotwelve.com/voice/what-is-meaningful-information.html" target="_blank">meaningful information</a>.</h3>
			<h4>But why is data powerful?</p>

			<h2 class="oswald">The Power of Data</h2>
			<h4>For this storytelling, we will use the 2013 national crime statistics which can be found <a href="http://data.gov.ph/dataset/national-crime-statistics">here</a>.</h4>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<h5>Data can be easily used to create misleading information. This is an example.</h5>

			<div id="ncr">
				<h3 class="emphasize">NCR</h3>
				<div class="container">

			<p>From this single chart of data from the dataset, people could start creating conclusions that NCR is the most unsafe place in the Philippines.</p>
			<p>Articles may come up from the media that the PNP is doing badly in the National Capital Region, causing people to have low satisfaction for their services.</p>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<h3>But is that really the case?</h3>

		<div id="deeper">
			<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>
			<h5>As we use more of data that we have, we find out more about the truth.</h5>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-vol-sol.png">
			<p>From this chart, we could actually see that the National Capital Region has the most number of crimes solved.

			<h5>Leading us to this chart.</h5>
			<img class="lg-img" src="images/crime-sol-eff.png">
			<h3>NCR has a Crime Solution Efficiency of</h3>
			<h3 class="emphasize">62%</h3>
			<p>From this chart, we could say that the National Capital Region is one of the top performers in solving crimes.</p>
			<p>This debunks our conclusion from the initial chart, that the National Capital Region is the most unsafe place in the Philippines.</p>

			<h2>The Big ?</h2>
			<h5>But how come NCR has a big number of crimes?</h5>
			<h3>Let me show you this chart.</h3>

			<h3>Do you see the pattern?</h3>
			<h5>If not, let me try that again.</h5>

			<h5>From this chart, you could probably see that the chart on total crimes is almost identical to the chart on population.</h5>
